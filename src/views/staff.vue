            I am Killian Patriowski, interested in everything about machines, but also the labyrinth that can be the network and its security, and incidentally a farmer player but bad ^^ "
            Future multi-game streamer, I can find myself on Osu! in standard mode, soon on WoW, Minecraft, and also on Warframe, LoL and Overwatch or Paladins.
            I'm still studying and learning with Sirius to maintain a network and these machines, the Cloudsdale system in this case, and expects to end up holding my personal network myself. In my spare time, I take care of communicating and correcting the various texts of Cloudsdale and Sirius Media Group on demand.
            Finally, I am one of the moderators twitch, YouTube and discord of Sirius and take care of listing and testing the numbers of false technical service.
