            I am Killian Patriowski, interested in everything about machines, but also the labyrinth that can be the network and its security, and incidentally a farmer player but bad ^^ "
            Future multi-game streamer, I can find myself on Osu! in standard mode, soon on WoW, Minecraft, and also on Warframe, LoL and Overwatch or Paladins.
            I'm still studying and learning with Sirius to maintain a network and these machines, the Cloudsdale system in this case, and expects to end up holding my personal network myself. In my spare time, I take care of communicating and correcting the various texts of Cloudsdale and Sirius Media Group on demand.
            Finally, I am one of the moderators twitch, YouTube and discord of Sirius and take care of listing and testing the numbers of false technical service.

            Hey, I'm Sirius the founder of Cloudsdale Radio & AnimeFM, I started the Cloudsdale Radio project in 2013 as a radio enthusiast and a technical challenge too. 
            I was, in time, studying telecommunications & networks. This is where I started having my first servers (VPS to start). 
            Basically, the goal was to create a functional radio 24/7 (or 247 as I like to say) that is automated at best. Then, as I went along, 
            I became attached to the project in such a way that I could not stop it, although there were moments of emptiness, moments when I got completely tired of it. 
            project, I am obliged to maintain it. Today Cloudsdale Radio is an infrastructure almost independent of 6 servers.
